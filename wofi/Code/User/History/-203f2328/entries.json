The table must include the following columns: Sale Date, Customer Name, Product Name, Quantity, Unit Value, and Total Value.\n\nAs an optional bonus, include a search field to filter the displayed sales by Customer Name or Product Name.\n\nThis application serves to modernize the viewing of daily sales summaries, replacing the manual decryption of an old, end-of-day .dat text file'","timestamp":1759415996316}]}
