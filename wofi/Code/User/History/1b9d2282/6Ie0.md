Project overview

This repository contains the frontend for Thera Lab's landing/hero experience built with Next.js (App Router) and React Three Fiber. The project focuses on a performant animated 3D background and a compact hero component.

Key technologies

- Next.js (App Router)
- React (functional components, hooks)
- React Three Fiber (three.js integration)
- three.js for low-level geometry and shaders
- TypeScript for types
- Tailwind CSS for layout and utilities

Goals

- Provide a striking but performant hero with 3D visuals
- Keep animations smooth on mobile by reducing detail and disabling mouse tracking
- Maintain clear, modular component structure to ease maintenance and extension

Contents of the repository

- `src/components/AsciiBackground/` - 3D scene and effects (AsciiBackground component)
- `src/components/HeroTitle/` - hero text, category rotation and small UI pieces
- `src/hooks/` - global hooks used across components
- `public/` - static assets, including `favicon.svg`
- `src/app/` - Next.js app routes and layout

Intended audience

- Frontend engineers working on design systems and animation-heavy UI
- Engineers familiar with React and three.js

Limitations and constraints

- Post-processing ASCII shader is GPU-intensive; keep dpr and antialias settings conservative for mobile.
- Many effects are toggled off on mobile to maintain performance.
